            <p>A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, 
                or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, 
                to various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer 
                language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>
            <p>Programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining
                 and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. 
                 The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions
                 is expressed by the abstraction principle.
                  This principle is sometimes formulated as a recommendation to the
                   programmer to make proper use of such abstractions.</p>

            <p>JavaScript often abbreviated JS,
                 is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
                  alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page
                   behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated
                    JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language 
                that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
                 prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
                  supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming 
                  interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
                   Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
            <code>var x = myFunction(4, 3);
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
                
                function myFunction(a, b) {
                  return a * b;
                }</code>

            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language 
                that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
                 It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once,
                  run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms 
                  that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
            <p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) 
                regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
                but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities
                 (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled
                  languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
                   particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]</p>
            <code>public class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                  System.out.println("Hello World");
                }
              }</code>

            <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                 emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as 
                 well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small
                  and large-scale projects.</p>
            <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                 including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
                  It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library</p>
            <code>x = 5
                y = "John"
                print(x)
                print(y)</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="C++">
            <header><h1>C++</h1></header>
            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the 
                C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time,
                 and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for
                  low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors 
                  provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM,
                   so it is available on many platforms</p>
            <p>C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded,
                 resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency,
                  and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[11] C++ has also been found
                   useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure
                    and resource-constrained applications</p>
            <code>#include <iostream>
                using namespace std;
                
                int main() {
                  cout << "Hello World!";
                  return 0;
                }</code>
